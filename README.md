# 🚦 The Role of Right-Turn-on-Red Traffic Lights in Pedestrian Accidents and Other Intersection Control Measures

---

## 🧠 About

This capstone project investigates the impact of **Right-Turn-on-Red (RTOR)** traffic signals on pedestrian safety in San Francisco. It focuses on identifying patterns and contributing factors behind pedestrian accidents at intersections permitting RTOR, and comparing them to other intersection control measures.

The project involves:

- Analyzing historical accident data to discover patterns in RTOR-related pedestrian incidents.
- Investigating variables such as time of day, weather conditions, and traffic volume.
- Building machine learning models to predict accident likelihood at intersections with RTOR.
- Identifying high-risk intersections to inform policy recommendations and urban planning strategies.
